# NAPC-2024

Every year at the end of the school year, I organize the NAPC (Noorderpoort Algorithm Programming Contest) at my job at Bit Academy Noorderpoort.

Here you can find the problem sets, datasets, and solutions. Note that all problem sets are written in Dutch, you might be able to find English versions of some of the problems online.
